IMPORTANT NOTES

* Gendarme "official" build system is based on the auto*/Makefile files
and tested on monobuild. See mono-tools on http://mono.ximian.com/monobuild/

* MonoDevelop and Visual Studio project files are NOT always up to date
with Makefiles. This depends on the developer making changes and his 
personal access to the developing environments.

## How To Become A Member ##
This project is currently in its initial stages. Until a first stable release is achieved, the project will be of internal nature (just a selected group of developers from HERMES SoftLab). You need to be a project member in order to modify the code. This is how you become one:
  1. Create a gmail account (if you haven't got one yet)
  1. Contact Igor Brejc with your account. He'll add you to the members list.
  1. Sign in into your Google Web account.
  1. Click on the "Profile" tab (top-right)
  1. Click on the "Settings" tab. You'll see the "GoogleCode.com Password". This is the password you'll need in order to access the SVN repository.

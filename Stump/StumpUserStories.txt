-------

The application should not block when (re)loading log files
----------------
The application should be able to show multiple log files at the same time.

NOTE: each log file would have its own tab.
----------------
The application would only reload log file if its tab is currently active.

NOTE: however, the app. should detect changes in ALL log files and indicate them in the tab 
(probably by using different font color or style).
---------------
The application should not lock files it is monitoring.

TESTS: Try to delete a file that is monitored.
---------------
There should be a global checkbox which would turn the log monitoring on/off.
---------------
The application should remember the log files which are currently monitored even if it is closed.

NOTE: it should also remember the settings for each of these files.
---------------
The application should hold a registry (history) of all log files it has monitored. The user can
then select a log file from the history and start monitoring it.

NOTE: it should be indicated to the user which of the files do exist on the disk.
---------------
The application should not fail if the log file is a on a remote source. It should check its availability
(without blocking)

NOTE: if the file is not available, its tab should indicate this.
---------------
The user should be able to delete the contents of the log file with one click.

#summary Design guidelines and coding style used in ProjectPilot.

== Introduction ==
In general we follow Microsoft's design guidelines. We use FxCop as part of the build, it enforces some of these guidelines. In future we might decide to go one step further and use Microsoft's StyleCop to enforce coding style even further.

== Some Coding Style Guidelines ==
This page describes only some of the most important coding style guidelines, for the rest of them please consult the links below.

=== Order Of Things In Classes/Interfaces ==
The order must follow these rules (in order of importance):
 # First the public stuff, then protected, then private
 # First constructors, then properties, then methods, then fields
 # Sorted alphabetically

=== Miscellaneous ===
 * Keep each class/interface in its own file.
 * Use 4 spaces instead of tabs in !VisualStudio. Otherwise changes of formatting will be shown as real changes.

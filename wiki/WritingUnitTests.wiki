#summary Contains some basic guidelines for writing unit tests.

 # First rule: *do write unit tests*. Code coverage is a more or less good indicator of how well certain code is covered with tests.
 # The test class should typically be named *WhatIsTested* Tests (example: `SessionStateTests`)
 # Give the test method a meaningful name (see example below).
 # Write *description of a test case* (test method) which will describe what the unit test does (what and how it tests). Keep it short but keep it useful:
 # *Keep tests short*. Try to test only one feature with a single test method. This will make tests more understandable for everybody and easier to detect what's wrong if the test fails.

Example test mathod:
{{{
        /// <summary>
        /// Tests creating of a new <see cref="ISessionState"/> object.
        /// </summary>
        [Test]
        public void FetchEmptySession()
        {
            using (ISessionState sessionState = sessionStorage.LoadSession("testId"))
            {
                Assert.IsNotNull(sessionState);
            }
        }
}}}

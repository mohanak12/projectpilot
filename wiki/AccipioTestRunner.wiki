#summary Ideas about the Accipio test runner tool

Requirements:
 * the runner should provide a command-line interface for running tests
 * ideally it should be possible to run tests inside VisualStudio (with debugging)
 * the runner should reference MbUnit.Framework assembly in order to use its assertion methods
 * after each test run, the runner should provide an XML log of acceptance test results. The log should contain:
  * version of the binaries that were tested
  * version of the test cases that were used (SVN revision or just date-time?)
  * a list of all test cases that were run
  * for each test case, the log should contain the result, duration, tags and the time the test was started
 * each test case can have three different outcomes:
  * successful - the test case has met the acceptance requirements criteria
  * failed - the test case did not meet the acceptance requirements criteria
  * postponed/ignored - the test code hasn't been written yet

#summary Describes the workfloe developers should follow when (before) committing their changes to the SVN.

Commit Workflow:
 # Save all files in the VisualStudio
 # Update from SVN
 # If there are any conflicts, resolve them (consult Igor Brejc if necessary)
 # Run *Build.bat* from the command line.
 # If the build fails, you have to integrate your changes to make the build run (that's why it's called "continuous integration" :). Then proceed back to step 1.
 # If the build runs...
 # In VisualStudio, open AnhkSVN's *Pending Changes* window and add all files with the *New* status to the Subversion.
 # After you've done this, use TortoiseSVN to commit all files *from root of the project*.
 # Don't forget to enter a (oneliner) commit message in the TortoiseSVN dialog. This will make tracking changes *much* easier.
 # You're done - now get back to coding :)
